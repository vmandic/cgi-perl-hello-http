# A simple CGI and Perl HTTP server

I always wanted to see what is this about, so I read on Wikipedia about it
and decided to ask ChatGPT to teach me about it and write some code.

This is a simple project to demonstrate the processing of a GET web request to a
`.cgi` script file with an option to interpret a query string parameter
with all of the joy of direct HTML ie. code injection through it.

## How to use

Just run the `./docker-build.sh` and then `./docker-run.sh` and enjoy the fun on: `http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/hello.cgi`
